🧠 Model Workflow

Image Preprocessing — Convert to grayscale, resize, and enhance contrast.

License Plate Detection — Use image segmentation and contour-based filtering.

Character Segmentation — Isolate individual characters.

CNN Classification — Predict characters using a trained CNN model.

Reconstruction — Combine predictions to form the license number.

📊 Results

Model achieves high accuracy on test images.

Robust against variations in lighting and background.

Suitable for integration into real-time surveillance or parking systems.
